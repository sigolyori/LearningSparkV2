# MAGIC To run the notebooks in this chapter, we recommend that you use the [Databricks Runtime for ML](https://docs.databricks.com/runtime/mlruntime.html) which comes pre-installed with many of the popular ML libraries which we use in this chapter (TensorFlow, MLflow, Hyperopt, XGBoost, etc). These notebooks have been tested with `9.1 ML LTS`.

# MAGIC If you do not use the ML Runtime, you will need to manually install many libraries.
